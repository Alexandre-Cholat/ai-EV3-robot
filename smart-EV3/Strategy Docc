Strategy:

Instead of navigating grid with unreliable and inaccurate color sensor, the robot will simply find the center of the envirnoment.

From the center, the 2.5 m ultrasound vision radius should be largely sufficent for detecting objects in the environment.

In such case, the only required position data is that of 
1) Knowing if the current position is close to center or not
2) Knowing which directing home base is for depositing objects

This strategy's main advantage is that it doesn't rely on the inaccurate and variable quality of the sensors on the robot.
Being perfectly dead center is not important, knowing exactly where the agent is doesn't matter either. All that is neccessary
is to find objects (quickly) and return them to base.

Proposed methods

Actions:

	boolean isPuck() - returns true if object in front is a puck (turns left and right to check contrast)
	

	void getPuck() - approaches puck and grabs it
	void goHome() - rotates to 180 angle and drops puck at home base
	void goToCenter() - finds center
		perpendicullarWall() - faces wall perpendicularly
