/**
 * EV3 robot control and integration package.
 * 
 * This package provides comprehensive functionality for controlling and
 * managing
 * LEGO Mindstorms EV3 robots using LeJOS (Java). It implements an intelligent
 * exploration, mapping, and object collection algorithm designed for autonomous
 * robotic behavior.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Architecture Overview:</b>
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Core Classes:</b> Provide fundamental robot operations including
 * position tracking, sensing (sensor data acquisition and interpretation),
 * and movement control (motor management and navigation).</li>
 * <li><b>Navigation Algorithm Classes (NavAlgo):</b> Implement higher-level
 * navigation and task planning algorithms that utilize core functionality
 * to accomplish complex navigation objectives.</li>
 * <li><b>Automate Class:</b> Serves as the orchestration and control layer,
 * managing the overall robot logic and behavior at the highest level.
 * Implements automata theory principles to define and control state
 * transitions and complex behavioral sequences.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This hierarchical design enables sophisticated autonomous behavior through
 * layered abstractions, from low-level sensor and motor control to high-level
 * task orchestration and state management.
